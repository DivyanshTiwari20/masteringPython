This repo contain python programes to master competitive prgraming :)


if num =0 or num =1 or num>0

if num<0 :
    invalid input
if num=0:
    factorial 1
if num>0:
    num*(num-1)

-> Recursion: In recursion you can call a fucntion inside an functinon.

Eg: def fucntion(n):
        if n=0 or n=1:
            return 1
        else:
            n* function(n-1) # In this line we are calling fucntion inside function 

print(fucntion(5)) 

# How it works:
1. First it will check num if num is 0 0r 1 it will return 1, if not it will go forther and and multiply 5*(5-1) " n* function(n-1)".

2. Then it will agin do same thing untill the n becomes 1. 

3. Because everytime it minus 1 from num (n) from the function.


-> Binary Search: Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding the index of a target element in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
